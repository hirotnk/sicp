# SICP

This is a personal record of learning SICP. Since I got a lot of help from various materials on the net, should it help someone learning SICP, I would be very delighted.


# Scheme
I used gauche. If you're using Mac, you can install it with:
```sh
brew install gauche
```
Then type:
```sh
gosh
```
In order to run your scripts, rlwrap was helpful. In order to use it, you can do:
```sh
rlwrap gosh
```
