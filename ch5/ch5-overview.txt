5.2 A Register-Machine Simulator

Build a register machine simulator that can run register-machine
language(controller).

5.4 The Explicit-Control Evaluator

Implement the metacircular evaluator (Scheme interpreter) using
register-machine language, showing how the underlying procedure-calling and
argument-passing mechanisms used in the evaluation process can be described in
terms of operations on registers and stacks.

5.5 Compilation

Run Scheme program on a register-machine whose controller is not a Scheme interpreter.
Implement a compiler that takes Scheme program and ouputs machine code that can run on a register-machine sumulator.
