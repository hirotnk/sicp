If `(parse-word verbs)' does not work, the amb tries `(list 'verb-phrase
(parse-verb-phrase) ..)'.  This means `(parse-verb-phrase)' is called again,
and again,.... to infinite loop:
Even if the order was exchanged, it will still fall into the infinite loop. 
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb
    (parse-word verbs)
    (list 'verb-phrase
      (parse-verb-phrase)
      (parse-prepositional-phrase))))


In the following case, `maybe-extend' will not be called if `(parse-word
verbs)' is failed(no verbs).
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (define (maybe-extend verb-phrase)
    (amb verb-phrase
      (maybe-extend
        (list 'verb-phrase verb-phrase (parse-prepositional-phrase)))))
  (maybe-extend (parse-word verbs)))
